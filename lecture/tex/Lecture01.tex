        The modulator allows to map continuous control decisions to discrete switching actions. This enables standard linear feedback controllers (i.e., well-understood simple control design) and ensures a predefined switching frequency and harmonic spectrum. However, the modulator delay limits achievable transient control performance.

        The indirect approach is slower since minimizing the current/flux control error is not garantuntying to minimize the torque control error at each time instant  (the torque to current / flux mapping comes with degrees of freedom for three-phase drives). However, in practice the transient control performance difference is typically minor.

        Due to costs, weight and volume of torque sensors, drive systems typically rely on indirect model-based torque estimation. In practice, only test benches and special application needs warrant direct torque measurement.
